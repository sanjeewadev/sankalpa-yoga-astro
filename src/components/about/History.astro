        <p class="text-text-muted mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          It started with a simple observation: modern yoga was losing its soul. It was becoming purely gymnastic, stripping away the breathwork, meditation, and philosophy that make the practice truly transformative.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We established Sankalpa to bridge the gap. We went back to the source texts—the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Sutras—and designed a curriculum that respects tradition while acknowledging modern anatomy and biomechanics.

        <p class="text-text-muted mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Sri Lanka is an island of healing. The climate, the food, and the culture are naturally aligned with the yogic lifestyle.

          Our campus in Ahangama is surrounded by cinnamon plantations and paddy fields. It is a place where time slows down, allowing students to disconnect from the digital world and reconnect with their inner silence.
